I was on my fourth year of college at University of California, Santa Cruz when I was introduced to programming in a programming class called "Introduction to Programming in JAVA". I was fascinated when I learned how programming work and that this is the kind of programming that was used created the technology we have today. I want to learn more about software development and dive deeper into the technology world.
