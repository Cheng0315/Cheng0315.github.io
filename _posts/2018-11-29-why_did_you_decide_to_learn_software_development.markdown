I was on my fourth year of college at University of California, Santa Cruz when I was introduced to programming in a programming class called "Introduction to Programming in JAVA". I was mind-blown when I learned how programming work and how everything in the technology world involved this kind of programmming. I want to learn more about software development and dive deeper into the technology world.
