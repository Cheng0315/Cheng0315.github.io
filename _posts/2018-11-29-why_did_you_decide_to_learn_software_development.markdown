Growing up in a musical family, I was exposed to many kinds of music - blues, jazz, classical, pop, rock, country, electronic - and that inspired me to become a music teacher.

After high school, I entered University of California, Santa Cruz school to pursue a degree in music education. As I got to the end of my third year, I was introduced to programming when I enrolled in a programming class called "Introduction to Programming in JAVA".  I fell in love with the class, and started doing research about programming. After two weeks of research, I came to the conclusion that programming is what I want to do as a career. I went to talk with my academic adviser to change my major, but unfortunately I was not able to as I already was on my third year and had already declared my major. I was devastated.

I graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz in 2017 with a degree in music and have been teaching music for over a year. I enjoy teaching music and love my students, but as much as I love my students, inside my heart I know I wanted to become a software developer. I love programming.
