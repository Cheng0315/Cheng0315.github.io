Object-oriented programming is based on four important fundamentals: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism

Encapsulation is  the bundling of related variables and methods together into a unit known as a class. This bundling reduce code complexity and increase code reusability. 

Inheritance is the concept of creating an object based on another object. This helps developers eliminate redundant codes. 

Abstraction is the process of hiding information/data/methods/properties/etc and only showing the necessary ones for the task at hand. Abstraction make the object's interface simpler and easier to understand.

Polymorphism is the ability to process different objects/data with the same interface. This helps developers get rid of long if/else, case, and switch statement.
