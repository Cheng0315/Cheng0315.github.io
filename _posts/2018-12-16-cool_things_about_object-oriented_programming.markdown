Object-oriented programming allows developers to do many cool things compare to non object-oriented programming. 

Object-oriented programming, for instance, allows developers to group related variables and methods together into a unit known as a class. This notion is called encapsulation, and it helps reduce code's complexity and increase code's reusability. 

Another cool thing about object-oriented programming is that it allows developers to use inheritance. Inheritance is the creation of an object based on another object. This helps developers eliminates redundant codes. 

Abstraction is another cool thing about object-oriented programming. It is the process of hiding information/data/methods/properties/etc and only showing the necessary ones for the task at hand. Abstraction makes the object's interface simpler and easier to understand.

And last is Polymorphism. It is the ability to process different objects with the same interface. This helps developers get rid of long if/else, case, and switch statement.

All these four cool things are known as the four pillars of object-oriented programming. Thay are what make object-oriented programming what they are.
