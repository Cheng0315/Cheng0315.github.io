Encapsulation
Encapsulation allows developers to group related variables and methods together into a unit known as a class. This  it reduce code complexity and increase code reusability. 

Inheritance
This concept allows developers to create an object based on another object. This helps developers eliminates redundant codes. 

Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of hiding information/data/methods/properties/etc and only showing the necessary ones for the task at hand. It makes the object's interface simpler and easier to understand.

Polymorphism
It is the ability to process different objects with the same interface. It helps developers get rid of long if/else, case, and switch statement.
