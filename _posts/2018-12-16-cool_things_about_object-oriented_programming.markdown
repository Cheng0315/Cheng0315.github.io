Object-oriented programming allows developers to do many cool things compare to non object-oriented programming (procedural programming). 

For instance, object-oriented programming allows developers to group related variables and methods into a unit known as a class. This is called encapsulation, and it helps reduce complexity of the codes and increase its codes usability. 

Another cool thing about object-oriented programming is that it allows developers to use inheritance. Inheritance is the creation of an object based on another object. This notion helps developers eliminates redundant codes. 

Abstraction is another cool thing about object-oriented programming. It is the process of hiding data/information/methods/properties/etc and only showing the necessary ones for the task at hand. This makes the object's interface simpler and easier to understand.

And the last is Polymorphism. Polymorphism is  the ability of different objects to respond differently to an identical interface. This helps developers get rid of long if/else, case, and switch statement.
