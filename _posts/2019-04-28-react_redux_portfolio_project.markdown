For my React Redux Portfolio Project, I created a restaurant web application for a Japanese restaurant. The application uses Rails API on the back end and React on the front end and has features such as CRUD and user authentication. 

In this application, the administrators/store owner can view information about the restaurant and create, update and delete dishes while users can view information about the restaurant.
