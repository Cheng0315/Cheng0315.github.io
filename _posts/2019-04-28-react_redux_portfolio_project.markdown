For my React Redux Portfolio Project, I created a restaurant web application for a Japanese restaurant. This application uses Rails API as the back end and React as the front end and has features such as CRUD and user authentication. 

Users who visit the website can view information about the restaurant and the dishes that the restaurant serves while the administrators or store owner can do the same things and also create, update and delete dishes.
