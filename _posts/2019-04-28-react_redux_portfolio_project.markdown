For my React Redux Portfolio Project, I created a restaurant web application for a Japanese restaurant. This application uses Rails API as the back end and React as the front end and has features such as CRUD and user authentication. 

Throughout the making of this application, I made many mistakes and learned many things from them. Also, I just want to say that this is my first React application and I'm already in love with the framework.
